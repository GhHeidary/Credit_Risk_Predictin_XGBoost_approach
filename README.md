# Credit_Risk_Predictin_XGBoost_approach

### This script is an implementation of a credit risk prediction model using XGBoost. The script uses various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Hyperopt.
## Installation
To run this script, you will need to install the following libraries:

    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    hyperopt
    xgboost

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn hyperopt xgboost
```

## Usage
### To use this script, you will need to download the attached file named Credit_Risk_Predictin_XGBoost_approach.py and save it to your local machine. You can then run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python Credit_Risk_Predictin_XGBoost_approach.py
```

The script will download a dataset of credit risk data, preprocess it, and train an XGBoost model for credit risk prediction. The results, including learning curves and confusion matrices, will be outputted to the console.
